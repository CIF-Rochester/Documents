\section{Participation Points}
\label{sec:participation-points}

Every member is expected to participate in CIF events, to help foster community, and to help promote the floor to the University community as a whole. At the beginning of every semester, Board chooses a quota for participation points, which are awarded as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 point for attending an event
	\item 2 points for helping with publicity for an event
	\item 3 points for helping the Logistics Director produce and run an event
	\item A number of points to be decided by Board for appointed positions
\end{itemize}
Points are awarded only for events announced with at least 48 hours notice.  Point accumulation must be reported to a member of Board or recorded on a sign-in sheet.

If a Member doesn't meet the point quota for a semester, they can request a waiver from Board; if it is not granted, they will be reduced to the next Membership level (Full to Associate, etc).

Board members are exempt from this requirement unless they are impeached or resign.

Members on leave (such as those studying abroad) will be exempt from participation point quotas.

The Secretary-Treasurer should keep running point totals in membership records and make them available to members upon request. Participation point totals reset at the beginning of every semester.
