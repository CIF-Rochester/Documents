\section{Membership}
\label{sec:membership}

All members have the following rights and responsibilities:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Attendance at Member Meetings (required for full members, encouraged for associates)
	\item Accumulation of Housing Points
	\item Notification of all public events
	\item Making Nominations
	\item Creating Petitions
\end{itemize}



	\subsection{Types of Membership}



		\subsubsection{Full Membership}

		Full Members have the following rights:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Voting
			\item Increased Housing Points/Priority
			\item Access to Members-Only Events
		\end{itemize}

		Full Members must pay semesterly dues!
		


		\subsubsection{Associate Membership}

		Associate Membership is a form of official association with CIF, intended to provide a simple way for interested parties to stay up to date with CIF activities without needing to pay dues or participate as fully as Full Members.

Associate Members may be only be selected to live on floor if the floor has fewer Full Members than available spaces. If living on floor, an Associate must apply for Full status and be subject to those responsibilities.



	\subsection{Acceptance of Members}

	Anyone who wishes to become a member must apply through the membership application provided on the website. Applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
	
	To be accepted, applicants must be interviewed at an open board meeting. If at least four board members vote in favor of an applicant, they are granted full membership. Board members may decide to offer the applicant an associate membership, with the understanding that their application will be re-evaluated during the semester.

Off-floor members may change their membership level (from full to associate, associate to affiliate, or leave entirely), provided they notify Board. Board approval is required for a change in status of an on-floor member.



	\subsection{Affiliation}

	If somebody wishes to hear about floor events but does not care to participate in the running of floor, they can ask to be an affiliate and will only be added to the appropriate mailing list.



	\subsection{Floor Dues}

	At the first board meeting of the spring semester, the board must decide on the amount of dues for the next two semesters and the deadline for spring semester dues. At the first board meeting of the fall semester the board must decide on the deadline for paying fall semester dues.

	Floor members who cannot pay their dues may request a waiver or reduction, with explanation. The waiver or reduction must be approved by a majority of board. 
	
	Floor members may pay their dues in the form of improvements to floor, if and only if they clear it in advance with the Secretary-Treasurer and provide receipts for all money spent.

	A floor member who does not pay dues by the deadline set, unless they have been given a waiver or reduction, is reduced to associate membership for the remainder of the semester and therefore losing all voting rights and access to Member-Only Events.
